# Microbiome-Time-Traveler-Predicting-Gut-Microbiome-Evolution-Using-LSTM
A deep learning–based time-series analysis project that predicts future gut microbiome composition using longitudinal data. This project uses an LSTM neural network trained on synthetic microbiome datasets to model microbial abundance changes over time, demonstrating how AI can forecast microbiome dynamics.
